My interest in scientific research originally began with my highschool AP chemistry class. After the course, I immediatly decided I wanted to purse a career as a scientist \(whatever that meant\). I attended [Northern Illinois University](https://www.niu.edu/index.shtml) where I joined the laboratory of [Dr. James R. Horn](https://hornlab.niu.edu/portfolio/port2/), where I focused on engineering protein-protein interactions in various model systems. It was in this lab that I found my passion for biochemisry and biophysics. 

In 2018, after receiving my B.S. in Chemistry, I pursed my Ph.D. in Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics at [Texas A&M University](https://bcbp.tamu.edu). I joined the plant biochemical research lab of [Dr. Timothy P. Devarenne](https://bcbp.tamu.edu/people/devarenne-tim/), where my thesis originally was suppose to focus on elucidating hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathways in the green microalgae _Botryococcus braunii_. During the COVID-19 pandemic, my research shifted to include sequencing and assembling the genomes of the chemical races of _B. braunii_ and performing a comparative genomic analysis of multiple _Chlorophyta_ species. You could have likely quoted me throughout my academic career as never needing to learn topics such as computer science, programming, or bioinformatics, as I had, mistakenly, thought for the research I wanted to be a part of, I would never need it \(how wrong I was!\).

After graduating with my Ph.D. in 2023, I joined the Bioinformatics Core within the [Texas A&M Insitute for Genome Sciences & Society](https://genomics.tamu.edu) where a majority of my time is dedicated to developing new bioinformatic tools, collaborating with other faculty and the private sector performing bioinforamtic analyses, and training the next generation of bioinformaticians through various coursework covering comparative omics, RNA/scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, protein structure prediction, etc.

My research is focused not a single field/topic, but rather on developing novel bioinformatics toolsets to enable other researchers. I place a large focus on creating approachable and easily accessible tools with a premier focus on open-source.
